School project : Detect the white ball and the cue one a frame taked by a camera, then compute the trajectory that the ball will take then draw the result on the table with a beamer. 

Note : We only had a couple of weeks to do this project and then we had to present it at the open day of our school. so the code is more or less functional, but is not really clean
